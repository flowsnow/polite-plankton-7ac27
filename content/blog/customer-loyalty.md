  Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
  Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so
  you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your
  infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking
  advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code
  quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and
  running it in production.
