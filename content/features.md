      The world of IT can be scary and intimidating,but it doesn't have to be
      that way.   If you have a grain of faith in YOU and can allocate 3-4 hours
      per day to study, YOU can achieve in 6 months what others are
      accomplishing in 4 years of College. Our curriculum is inspired from the
      real life corporate IT world, combined with all the cool new technologies.
      We primarily focus on Linux, Ansible, AWS and Kubernetes. But we also
      cover Docker, Git, Terraform, Python to name a few. After the technical
      level is achieved we guide our students through the interview process, as
      getting in the right set of mind is crucial to success

    title: What is Kubernetes vs Docker?
    subtitle: "A fundamental difference between Kubernetes and Docker is that\_Kubernetes is meant to run across a cluster while Docker runs on a single node. Kubernetes is more extensive than Docker Swarm and is meant to coordinate clusters of nodes at scale in production in an efficient manner."

      Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure
      so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your
      infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking
      advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying
      code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code
      and running it in production.
